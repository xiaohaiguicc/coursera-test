# Recipe Finder Solution

So... you have worked hard to code up a solution to the Recipe Finder app. The chances are you probably even have all of your local tests passing. (If not, I highly recommend that you try to get to this point.)

But when you try to submit the app - it is just not working!!! Aargh!!! :scream: :angry:

This could happen for many reasons:

1. The grader currently only supports Rails version 4.2.x and you are using Rails 5.x
2. Your directory structure is not what the grader is expecting. (Perhaps you have a folder inside the .zip file and your `app` folder is inside that folder as opposed to the `app` folder being directly inside the .zip file).
3. A million other possible reasons... We tried anticipating different combinations of what could go wrong and guiding you through the solution, but it is very possible that we missed something. Besides, each platform and Operating System has its own little quirks...

**But - hard work needs to be rewarded!** :joy:

So, here is what you can try doing

1. Hit the green **Clone or Download** button at the top right corner of this repository 
2. Choose **Download ZIP**
3. Download the .zip file and submit it!!! :triumph: :triumph: :triumph:

If above works - compare your solution to the solution in this repository.
